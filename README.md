While TESLACORE I.R.D.C. embraces free and open-source software (FOSS) licenses that provide freedom and flexibility, we also prioritize safeguarding these resources from cyber threats.

TESLACORE I.R.D.C. values the open-source ecosystem and is dedicated to preserving the integrity of FOSS resources against exploitation by malicious entities. This approach is strictly defensive, implemented in response to the increasing incidence of cybercrime, and aligns with our support of open-source development and technological freedom.
